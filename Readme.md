# Classification of Breast cancer using mechine learning
- Breast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the breast tissue. It is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide, and it can also affect men. The cancer cells typically form a tumor that can be felt as a lump or seen on a mammogram. The cancer can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, lungs, or bones.
- Machine learning (ML) is an area of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that can analyze and learn from data. In the context of breast cancer, ML can be used to develop predictive models that can help diagnose the disease, predict its progression, and identify which type of cancer it is
- In this training model we trained this model on 569 cases which is a combination of Benign and Malignant
- It gives the output as 1 if Benign is found else o if Malignant is found
